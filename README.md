#  Learn Composer smart contract language

### 1. Install the Hyperledger Composer Extension for VSCode

The chaincode is highlighted in the **VSCode**, thus convenient for modifying and learning.
Follow the instructions here, [Install the Hyperledger Composer Extension for VSCode](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-prereqs)

##### When you import Composer chaincode folders into VSCode, you are able to read the chaincode easier.

### 2. For beginers to learn Composer contract

This [tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/playground-tutorial.html) is intended to act as an introduction to Hyperledger Composer concepts using the [online playground environment](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/).

In this step by step tutorial you'll walk through setting up a business network, defining the assets, participants and transactions, and testing the network by creating some participants and an asset, and submitting transactions to change the ownership of the asset from one to another.

- Note that, for Chinese users, you should solve the  *Internet access blocked* to visit the website [online playground environment](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/) successfully.  If  you can't see samples on npm,  refresh the page until you see them.

```

There are many application scenarios in this repository. Open these folders in VSCode,  learn the Composer contract in highlighted code. 

Folllow the README.md guidance in the folder of each application scenario, and practice them in the Composer playground to learn about the transaction workflow of Composer.

Good luck!  : )
